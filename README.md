# Are Two-High Safeties Ruining the NFL?

An interactive data visualization project analyzing 10 years of NFL defensive coverage trends (2015-2024).

## Overview

This project challenges the popular narrative that two-high safety defenses are limiting explosive offensive plays in the NFL. Through interactive visualizations, we reveal that defenses aren't actually running more two-high coverages—they're just disguising them better through pre-snap rotations.
